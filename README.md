# MNIST-Project
This is my MNIST Project that includs a dataset which has 60,000 pictures of handwritten digits. I implemented this project by pytorch and i used Convolutional neural network (CNN) to diagnose handwritten digits and at the end i earned 99% accuracy in validation dataset. It was enjoyable for me and i hope it is for you too.
